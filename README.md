# Lung-Cancer-Predictor-Model
Uol Data Science CM3005 Midterm

This data science project involves building a regression model for predicting lung cancer with Python, using Jupyter Notebook. A CSV dataset from Kaggle is used to retrieved common lung cancer symptoms, loaded into the notebook, clean and processed. Analysis is done on the dataset by plotting charts and graphs, and correlated symptoms are chosen for the predictor model. Further details can be found in the Jupyter Notebook, "ds_midterm_BuildARegressionModel.ipynb".
